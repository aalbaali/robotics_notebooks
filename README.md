# In this repo
This repo holds documentation and notes related to robotics.

The notes are written as Julia notebooks using [Pluto](https://www.google.com/search?q=pluto+julia&oq=pluto+julia&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l2j0i20i263i512j0i512l2j69i60l3.1467j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

# Running notebooks locallly
Running the notebooks locally requires Julia to be installed on the system and Pluto package be installed in Julia.

Then, simply run Pluto using
```julia
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```

# Running the notebooks online
It's possible to run the notebook on the web using [Glitch](http://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/).
To run a specific Julia notebook, go to the notebook on this Github repository, click on `Raw`, then copy the URL into Glitch.

The notebook may not work immediately and may require some restarts before it works on Glitch.
